# CECECO-SIM: Simulation & Integration Module

## 🌍 Overview

CECECO-SIM is a Multi-AI Agent architecture designed to facilitate cross-border knowledge transfer and project simulation for clean energy initiatives in the CECECO region (Azerbaijan, Turkey, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan).

## 🎯 Key Features (Demo Prototype)

- **Interactive Regional Map**: Visualize CECECO countries and project locations
- **Case-Based Reasoning**: Analyze project transferability between countries
- **AI Agent Simulation**: Watch multi-agent system in action
- **Policy Transfer Learning**: Simulate economic impact of policy transfers
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify regulatory and economic differences

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## 🎨 Features Demonstrated

1. **Regional Map Tab**: Interactive map showing all CECECO countries with markers
2. **Project Analysis Tab**: Side-by-side comparison of source and target projects
3. **AI Simulation Tab**: Animated demonstration of multi-agent workflow
4. **Transfer Learning Tab**: Economic impact projections and policy recommendations

## ⚠️ Note

This is a **demo prototype** for demonstration purposes. All features are simulated with mock data to illustrate the concept and architecture. The actual implementation would require:

- Real-time data scraping from official sources
- Vector database integration (ChromaDB)
- LLM integration for analysis
- Knowledge Graph construction
- UNIDO GN-SEC API integration

## 🔮 Future Development

- Real AI agent implementation
- Live data scraping from official gazettes
- Vector database for project snapshots
- Knowledge Graph construction
- UNIDO API integration
- Multi-language support
